## Self-Reflection:
I ran into some issues with the auto grading on this assignment, when I checked my answers without using DOM, they were correct. My auto graded kept saying that 'document' wasnt defined, but when I ran the code, it properly ran. I was unable to get the word counter functioning for this assignment as well. I was able to create a variable that counted the words and counted the characters everytime you typed into text input. I was unable to append the text at the bottom of the page with the updated values.
